Wednesday... debugging...
stream edit to update jquery-1.3.2 to jquery-1.6.2, and include validation plugin

Wrapped in fieldsets: surgicalhistory6.asp (fixed required too), cancerrisk26.asp, familyhistorycancer6.asp, familyhistorycancer7.asp, qualityoflife5.asp, surgicalhistory9.asp, surgicalhistory10.asp, surgicalhistory21.asp
(Not wrapped in fieldsets due to pattern not patching; checked remaining files to verify, put output in NotWrappedFiles.txt). 

added legend to several cancerrisk* files that had none; (verified with grep that all files that contain a fieldset have at least one legend)

womensrisk6.asp: changed class to eitherNoneOrCheckedNested, added requiredIfBranchActive to nested radios

surgicalhistory9.asp: added requiredIfPreviousCheckbox to all Year inputs
surgicalhistory9: added year class for year inputs (assumed it was desired)
surgicalhistory10: huge! added "howMany required" and "year required" to inputs 

surgicalhistory21: removed tracheotomy from "head" checkboxes, wrapped all checkbox lists in fieldsets with class "surgicalCheckboxes", added requiredIfPreviousCheckbox

familyhistorycancer1: moved class eitherNegativeResponseOrChecked to fieldset
familyhistorycancer6, 7: added required to radios, added classes to checkboxes and enclosing tr for constraints
familyhistory2.asp: make class consistent with familyhistorycancer6 and 7, add require class to radios

cancerrisk1: add required class
cancerrisk19b3: fix typos in attribute names


Sunday, 2011-10-23
css/styles.css: fixed .column1, .column2, and .column3 to use display: inline-block instead of float and clear. This fixed the "collapsed parent div" issue in:
	demographics1.asp
	personalhistorycancer5.asp
	pastmedical1.asp
	pastmedical8.asp
	currentsymptoms9.asp
	currentsymptoms10.asp
	... and others

Thursday, 2011-10-27, mitch
fixed pastmedical1 and several others: eitherNoneOrChecked implementation is buggy - fixed in script.js, checked in several files
"     currentsymptoms3, 4, 5, several others : eitherNoneOrChecked implementation is buggy
"     womensrisk6, 7, 13: eitherNoneOrChecked implementation is buggy
"     familyhistorycancer8: eitherNoneOrChecked implementation is buggy
"     familyhistory1: eitherNoneOrChecked implementation is buggy
"     cancerrisk10: eitherNoneOrChecked implementation is buggy; uses class on enclosing spans
"     cancerrisk12, 13, 14, 16, 17b, 25: eitherNoneOrChecked implementation; uses class on enclosing fieldset
"     psychosocial3: eitherNoneOrChecked implementation; uses class on enclosing fieldset
fixed pastmedicalhistory2: using "atLeastOneCheckboxRequired" instead of eitherNoneOrChecked
fixed familyhistorycancer3: multiple negative radios, called it "eitherNoneDontKnowOrChecked" - fixed interactions on "required" for radios/checkboxes when navigating between pages (not accounting for existing data)
fixed womensrisk6: html code with multiple radios as descendants might not work with the current implementation of eitherNoneOrChecked (changed to eitherNoneOrCheckedNested) -changed back to eitherNoneOrChecked, fixed implementation; 
fixed familyhistorycancer1: needs rule: coordinate checkbox exclusive of radios on; using class "eitherNegativeResponseOrChecked" on enclosing div for this case, where any radio checked is a negative response - changed to eitherNoneDontKnowOrChecked class; should work exactly like the others (label doesn't matter, all radioes taken as negative responses)
fixed cancerrisk3, 4, 5: radio needs to be made mutually exclusive with text input; using class "eitherNegativeResponseOrInput" on enclosing div, using 'daysPerWeek' for input preceding the radio button
fixed pastmedical3: need rule: if colon unchecked, age and # clear; if other unchecked, specify clears - added one-off script in pastmedical3
fixed pastmedical3: fixed incorrect id on Colon checkbox
fixed personalhistorycancer3: If “No Treatment” selected, other 4 checkboxes must clear (and vice versa, i.e., combo of Radiation/Chemo/Surgery/Other OR No Treatment; called this eitherCheckboxOrNoTreatment, on each input, each set nested beneath a <tr> - added eitherCheckboxOrNoTreatment handler; 
fixed requested to add HTML maxlength attribute to inputs whereever validation calls for maxlength
   - fixed size 2 requirements:age|years|yearsWithZero|smokingRange|exposureYears|heightInches|hours|minutes|dateMonth|dateDay
   - fixed size 2 requirements:howMany|exposureHoursPerWeek|cigarettes|weightPounds|alcoholConsumption
   - fixed size 4 requirements:dateYear
tested and fixed the existing handlers for fieldset-level rules: eitherNoneOrChecked, eitherNoneDontKnowOrChecked


Monday, 2011-10-31, mitch
fixed familyhistorycancer6, 7: rules needed between checkboxes and radios; called the class "eitherOneOrTwoOrMoreCheckboxes" on the tr enclosing the checkboxes
fixed familyhistory2: uses rule for "eitherOneOrTwoOrMoreCheckboxes" on the tr enclosing the checkboxes, like familyhistorycancer6, 7
fixed personalhistorycancer5: implemented atLeastOneCheckboxIfBranchActive
cleaned up bugs/notes/questions and got rid of extra junk in todo

Saturday, 2011-11-05, Justis
Sunday, 2011-11-06, Justis
merged the refactor_hidden branch into master, which includes:
+ simplified a lot of code.
+ removed a bunch of unused code.
+ moved code that was specific to surgicalhistory21.asp into scripts_js/surgicalhistory21.js.
+ most logic for .qTrigger*, .qTriggerOff*, and .hiddenQ* is now in a single block for consistency.
+ should have resolved most .qTrigger bugs.
+ improved coverage for show/hide questions when navigating back to pages already answered.
+ implemented .requiredIfBranchActive for all .qTrigger*, instead of just the few that had been active.

Monday, 2011-11-07, Justis
+ cleaned up the git working directory in DevEPQv3
+ setup private developer directories and domain names for Matthew and Justis
+ fixed formatting for questions box on pastmedical11.asp

Tuesday, 2011-11-08, Justis
+ de-duplicated validation messages so that we don't get a bunch of "This field is required" in the legend
+ fixed .atLeastOneCheckboxIfBranchActive logic on personalhistorycancer5.asp and cancerrisk15.asp
+ fixed .atLeastOneCheckboxRequired on pastmedical8.asp
+ fixed qTrigger rules on womensrisk2.asp
+ none/neither are now mutually exclusive of "don't know" in familyhistorycancer1.asp and familyhistorycancer3.asp

Tuesday, 2011-11-08, mitch
fixed: pastmedical4.asp 'year' field requires number from 0-99, should be from 1900-2011 (really fancy if up to current year so no updated needed in 2012)
       also found in pastmedical13b1.asp,pastmedical13b2,pastmedical13b3,pastmedical13b4,pastmedical13b5,pastmedical16b,pastmedical17b
fixed: test-2011-11-07; Small grey block appears between Green instruction block and datagrid
       This could be as simple as setting the fieldset style to white background
       qualityoflife5.asp is an example ( This is the Legend part of the
			 fieldset, when no content is provided only the background shows. )
fixed: currentsymptoms11.asp - if you choose a MH item, then the 2nd question appears.  If you select None, the other checkboxes clear but the 2nd question remains answered. It should clear and hide
fixed again: (table field labels):  updated class on fieldset and style rule to eliminate green rectangle: cancerrisk10.asp, cancerrisk26.asp, cancerrisk7.asp, cancerrisk71.asp, cancerrisk8.asp, cancerrisk9.asp, css/styles.css, familyhistory2.asp, familyhistorycancer6.asp, familyhistorycancer7.asp, personalhistorycancer3.asp, qualityoflife5.asp, surgicalhistory10.asp, surgicalhistory9.asp

Thursday, 2011-11-10, mitch
Verified the fixes made by Justis:
## bugs which may be repaired from Justis's recent .qTrigger fixes. These need to be retested:
bug in general: forms with a qTrigger aren't requiring requiredIfBranchActive, so with 2 levels of questions only one of the sets will be activated 
note womensrisk6,cancerrisk[345]: note that qTrigger*/requiredIfBranchActive behavior is not working here either
bug womensrisk6: qTrigger doesn't trigger requiredIfBranchActive
bug cancerrisk17, 23, 24: qTrigger not working to activate requiredIfBranchActive
bug visitbackground2.asp: hidden fields are not shown when navigating back to the page and "No" is checked
note familyhistorycancer*: strange interaction between "None" and "Don't Know" radio inputs due to the different naming/ids of the fields
visitbackground2: hidden text fields and radios not clearing when branch is deactivated; corrected in scripts.js 
cancerrisk18: added required class to number input fields per github issue ticket
womensrisk5: question: not required on PPT; should it be? (Yes) Added required class to radio

confirmed fixed: bug familyhistorycancer5: formatting is off
fixed visitbackground1.asp: date must be clear if never selected. added eitherNegativeOrDate class rule
fixed familyhistory2, familyhistorycancer6,7: require a radio selection on each row, and at least one checkbox

Friday, 2011-11-11, mitch
fixed cancerrisk21: Added qTrigger2Off class to first and second radio elements to trigger the correct hiding and clearing behavior for number of days per month. 
fixed cancerrisk15, and a few other qTrigger2 cases of hidden fields not being re-hidden or cleared when a checkbox was unchecked
fixed a few cases of hidden fields not being re-hidden or cleared when Other/Specify checkbox was automatically changed

Monday, 2011-11-14, mitch
corrected ui behavior for qTrigger on cancerrisk3, 4, and 5, in script.js
