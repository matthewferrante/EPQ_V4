note currentsymptoms162: didn't reach during testing
note pastmedical5: couldn't reach this page while testing, but the coding is there
note pastmedical18: couldn't reach this page in testing
note currentsymptoms*: observed strange interaction between "Other" text field input and None radio buttons; text input doesn't uncheck radio, radio doesn't clear text input
note surgicalhistory9: couldn't reach this page. need to check that class atLeastOneRowCheckboxRequired implementation works
note womensrisk9: there _is_ a womensrisk9 file, to answer the PPT: made it required
note surgicalhistory9: added year class for year inputs (PPT does not specify numeric restrictions on month or year)
note surgicalhistory10: assumed how many is numeric, year is numeric year range 1-99

question pastmedical2b: (this page was not listed in the presentation file)
question pastmedical4: powerpoint says "if No, checkboxes clear." but no "No" radio is present on this page.
question surgicalhistory 3, 4, 5, 8: not listed on PPT, did not wrap in fieldset or add required class
question surgicalhistory21: the PPT requirement "must make one selection" doesn't seem to be reasonable given the questions; added a class "surgeryCheckboxes" to each wrapping fieldset
question familyhistorycancer2: it isn't on the presentation slides; multiple negative radios, eitherNoneOrChecked could be adapted to this case too; will call it "eitherNoneDontKnowOrChecked"
question qualityoflife3.asp: formatting
